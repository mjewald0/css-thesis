Core code: CSS_project_final_MJE.Rmd

Supplementary code to obtain Reddit comment data: filterscript_casual.py and filterscript_political.py

Note that I have not added the full Reddit data to this repository. The files are each 80-100 MB after pre-processing, which is too large for Github. These data can be obtained via the provided Python scripts.

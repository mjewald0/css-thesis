2023-08-19	New Hampshire is meaningless at any point. The whole reason the Democrats are moving to cut Iowa and New Hampshire out of going first is that they don't really represent the country as a whole.  It has a tiny delegate count and most Republican primaries are winner take all. Meaning second place can net you literally nothing.	111571	r/PoliticalDiscussion	377706

2023-11-17	seems like I've always had problems making friends with other girls. it may be my resting bitch face but I swear I'm not mean lol. I'm also not an ass-kisser, as many girls try to do subliminal 'tests' to see if you're a 'real' friend by throwing you into potential drama. not my thing.  in middle and high school it seemed like people who had their own clique wouldn't even want to be friends with anyone outside that group, until they got into an argument/fight. It can be lonely not having friends, but as I got older I realized I didn't really need them, as my family and loved ones are who matters and that the people who are meant to be in my life will be and nothing will be forced.  don't feel ashamed or have any negative feelings about the rumors made up about you OP, I'm sure the girls you may have had in mind while writing your post are the same ones that started the rumors about your reputation bc they're jealous you're friends with guys they couldn't get.	248487	r/CasualConversation	240076

2023-09-24	I had a dog growing up who looked like a black fox.  He wasn‚Äôt much of a cuddler, but he did mellow as he aged.  He was crazy fast snagging treats and we had worked out a system where he‚Äôd sit by me for dinner and he‚Äôd eat all the stuff I didn‚Äôt like (up to and including Brussels Sprouts).  One day we got busted and he was banned from the dining room.  He would wind up our big dumb lab cross and when my parents went to go see what the ruckus was he‚Äôd zip in for dinner bits.  It was a heck of a system!   Of course he also ate my crayons once but the rainbow colored poo in the yard was kind of artistic looking.	120202	r/CasualConversation	116171
2023-09-01	I think this is highly dangerous to the case against Trump, to all of them. Donald Trump has the constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury. The only way a bench trial can happen is if Trump were to agree to give up that right in writing, and if the state and court agreed. So maybe 30-35% of the voting age population in the USA politically supports Trump, many of those to an extremely high degree, as some Trump supporters are quite blind in their devotion, as are many supporters of other politicians.  So, what happens when the jury is hung because they have at minimum two or three of his supporters seated? They do it again with a new jury, and they have the same problem, as a criminal case requires a unanimous verdict, as as you cannot exclude jurors based on how they voted effectively. Sure the prosecution could choose to use their exclusions on Trump voters based on social media, and the defense could exclude the most ardent democrat voters, but there are only so many exclusions. The defend and prosecution cannot eliminate them all in a trial for the most politically polarizing figure I have ever seen. So in reliably democrat Fulton County Trump won 26% of the vote, meaning it will be difficult to exclude all of his supporters, and could he said to not be an impartial jury if it is composed of all Biden voters.  Now there are people who can say they didn‚Äôt vote, and some who don‚Äôt have social media to check, but who hasn‚Äôt seen anything on this case? And the jury pool cannot contain people who have seen prejudicial information, which perhaps could be said for the first jury seated, but with Donald Trump who can be sure of that? In Fulton County Trump could make the case of not getting an impartial jury, and a hung jury is as likely with Trump as I think any jury decision in the country. And that is for the first Jury, if it is hung they have to seat a new one and try again, with jurors who were able to live stream the first trial, and who have seen prejudicial information. And then there are all of the other cases, now which will have juries who have also been able to livestream prejudicial information. We might already be headed to a series of hung juries and mistrials, but now we may be headed to the inability to seat an impartial jury.	130514	r/PoliticalDiscussion	393795

2023-10-12	The main difference here is the response after the attack. 9/11 was a single attack that instantly wiped thousands and the response teams were pretty quick to the scene once it happened. In Israel, for many it was a whole day of being butchered and being lost with no one picking the phone on the other side. The government was nowhere to be found. The government isn't only responsible for letting the attack happen, it's responsible for letting it continue which is way worse. The other major difference is the climate in Israel leading up to it. The Israeli government was deeply unpopular even before this, and if there were elections they would've likely been replaced. Think about it, there have been 40 straight weeks of protests against the government there with military reservists signing petitions of their plans to resign from duty. It was a struggle that tore the country in two quite literally and definitely contributed to what happened here.  (Not to mention creating a huge rift with the US, which given happy Israelis are now with Biden is a huge no-no).    So when you take all that in, I can't see Netanyahu sailing through this even if he does a superb job here, he will never win over the other side which is almost half the country. He can only manage to quell the rage in his base and hang on the seat, but thus risking an actual civil war developing internally. So I think the natural end here would be Netanyahu and his government stepping down under the promise this whole fiasco be swept under the rug and a bonus treat for Netanyahu is sweeping his criminal case under the rug as well. All under the desire to move past it all and bring unity to the country.	4419	r/PoliticalDiscussion	284902

2023-10-03	All Trump every did was make excuses. Have you ever watched a full Trump press conference, or any of his rallies, or any of his ramblings on Truth Social? What about his promise to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. Did it happen? What happened to his promise to repeal Obamacare? Did that happen? And don‚Äôt give me the cop out answer that the elites stopped him. He had a Republican majority in the House and Senate in his first 2 years as President.  The problem with you Trump supporters is that you claim that he will fix all the problems without explaining what he will actually do other then ‚ÄúOwn the libs,‚Äù whatever that means. You also weirdly ignore all the promises he had broken when he was President.	38561	r/PoliticalDiscussion	314500
2023-08-09	I literally just read about 2 new laws effective 7/1/2023 that impact schools. Governors office and State Board of Education rolled out this week.  A. There is a special form in case your child wants to go by a name other than their legal birth certificate name. Example you are named Jennifer but often are called Jen. You would need this form filled out. So not just for trans children for all children who want another name used.  B. Shakespeare is too heavy on sexual context. So no class can read an entire book (this is in reference to high school students). So instead can use excerpts only. So teachers are working to revise that material to match new Florida standards.  C. Other items being removed so children have more time to study for new end of year classic online tests.

2023-10-21	I'm curious if this happened on Reddit or IRL. The question is a bit loaded, but in my view making a fair point. 1. If Gaza is in need of resources and giving them resources would be the morally right thing, why is Hamas using things like water pipes for rockets? It seems that as long as Gaza is under Hamas control, life cannot get better for Palestinians because the aid that can be sent has to be severely restricted. 2. It's pretty clear that some of the resources used in the attack on Israel came from outside of Gaza and were smuggled in. What does it say about the state of Gaza's leadership that people are smuggling weapons that will absolutely make life worse for the average Palestinian in Gaza? My simple take is that the civilians of Gaza are between a rock and a hard place. Hamas benefits from the suffering of those civilians, and Israel doesn't care enough about them to call off strikes on Hamas that may incur collateral damage (which is artificially inflated due to Hamas' use of civilian structures and civilian gathering points as firing points). With all this said, I lean towards support or tolerance of Israel's attack on Palestine, because Israel could potentially shift their treatment of the Palestinian zones through social and democratic change, but Hamas will never improve life for Palestinians and won't relinquish their power without force.	23374	r/PoliticalDiscussion	301387

2023-10-07	I'm not sure you're arguing what you think you are. I mean you give two possibilities: Receipts go down, spending goes up, debt goes up.  Receipts stay the same, spending goes up, debt goes up. Our lived reality is the first. You're arguing for the second.  For your argument to work you'd have to argue that we get something, as a society, out of low tax rates but that's difficult. Almost all of the wealth from reduced rates have fueled elite consumption, i.e., it's essentially just wasted output. So you really should be arguing for the unsaid option, higher taxes and reduced mandatory spending. I.e., optimal is, Receipts stay the same, spending goes up slightly less, debt goes down. >If we can get discretionary spending under control without gutting those programs then we should be able to accomplish the same with mandatory spending. The social spending programs I'm aware of that fall in discretionary spending have in fact been gutted. So I can't really see the antecedent being true. (Like you just can't make unemployment insurance more efficient to lower costs you have to just cut people off of the service.) >Yet we won‚Äôt even try to touch it beyond adding more programs to accelerate spending. I mean Medicare and Social Security are called the third rail for a reason right. You touch it and you die. More to the point, there have been multiple attempts to control costs they've just all failed because lobbyists.	47592	r/PoliticalDiscussion	322295

2023-10-15	Everybody needs to understand something.  1) Palestine and the  people is no such thing, they never existed. Gaza region belonged to EGYPT however when they went to war with Israel and lost big time, Ireal got GAZA. However Israel listened to the US and gave Gaza back in an attempt to make Peace with Egypt. The Egyptians gave it to the people there. Now people are going to say how about 5 century where the Herodotus called that region palestine, Fine that is True, No argument from me there. Now you will say See you are wrong palestine existed. Now I counter yes that may be true, ""palestine"" may have existed but not the people. In fact Islam did not come about till the 7 century so there would have been no Palestinian islamist that called that region home. I would also like to counter In the early 2nd century CE, the term ""Syria Palaestina"" (literally, ""Palestinian Syria"" was given to the Roman province of Judaea either before or after the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135. That whole region was techniqly called Judaean-samaria  2) The people elected Hamas into power  3) Israel tried for peace, they really did, However Arafat and Hamas both said that they deny the existence of a jewish state.  4) Hamas uses hospitals, and uses it's own people as shields in order to protect themselves from attack.	10753	r/PoliticalDiscussion	290420

Once I made salads (only vegetables) for 4: me, two sisters, mom. I put a little drop of barbeque sauce in the center, on a whim, in addition to their dressing in the salad. They ate it! I've only done it maybe twice since then. Raisins! I like to put raisins in mixed-greens type salads because they add some chewiness to them. And I love sugar, so that little sweetness is good, too. Iceberg lettuce, spinach, tomato, thin-skinned carrots & celery, a few crushed croutons, raisins. Maybe cheese as an ingredient or garnish. Try lemon or lime juice by itself as a dressing!

2023-09-19	Maybe I'm too generous but I've always thought of a retirement track for Congressmen who wish to stay for the long haul. * Under the rules of their party caucus, one must vacate all party and committee leadership posts at the first Congress after they turn 65. They then assume backbencher status as ""elder statesmen"". * All Congressmen and Senators must retire at the end of their current term if they turn 70 within 365 days of 1 November (exact date since federal elections are held on the Tuesday after the first Monday of October) of their election year. * A Congressman or Senator may apply to seek one more term, with two officially-submitted letters of support from their chamber's leader (either the Speaker or President pro tempore) and their state governor. Said support should then be certified by a supermajority of their chamber, and then given final *pro forma* approval by the FEC. * Only then can the Congressman or Senator run for re-election, and may not run again for Congress, and is prohibited from seeking another elected federal office, meaning President or Vice President. That means exchanging your final term for a chance at higher office. * The hard cap for retirement will then be 73 for the House, and 77 for the Senate.	142822	r/PoliticalDiscussion	404349

2023-09-10	Banning things doesn't stop them. We see it with drugs still to this day. We saw it with alcohol in the 1920s. All banning drugs has done is lead to a rise in crime, drug rings, cartels, etc. And the ban on alcohol just lead to increased organized crime, speakeasys, etc. Personally, I think the anti-abortion crowd will lose steam once all the silents and boomers have passed away. Generally speaking, they tend to be more conservative and more religious, both are which are generally aligned with anti-abortion views. Younger folks like millennials and zoomers tend to be more left leaning and pro-choice, generally speaking. Are there exceptions to both of these? Yes, of course, but I'm just speaking in general terms.	131159	r/PoliticalDiscussion	394341

The US also successfully ended the threat of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. There haven't been attacks on the US mainland from there ever since.  It's ok to say the costs aren't worth it, but it's wrong to say it's ineffective. If the sole goal is to stop Hamas from terrorizing Israelis, killing them and decimating their infrastructure will work. It'll just also mean killing tens of thousands of civilians.	36185	r/PoliticalDiscussion	312547

He was then reelected in 1904 and served a full 4 year term In 1908, he chose not to run again out of a desire to keep to the 2 term precedent that had held since Washington (Roosevelt had also pledged not to run for a third term during the 1904 election) and instead backed Taft (a friend for the last 20 years and his Secretary of War) as his handpicked successor. By 1912 however, his falling out with Taft and the schism in the Republican party led him to decide to run again	133470	r/PoliticalDiscussion	396430

I don‚Äôt want to pick a pronoun. I may not be cool with drag queens reading books to kids. I may not be cool with my daughter sharing a bathroom with a 40-year-old trans woman. I may not agree that you can be gender-fluid and that gender is a made up construct. I may be ok with *you* believing that but I may not be ok with you trying to force *me* to believe that.  Not because it‚Äôs wrong, necessarily. It‚Äôs just too much and too soon.  Some of these concepts - male and female - are *thousands* of years of societal norms and traditions. Some of them are even baked into religious dogma.  You don‚Äôt just get to pretend those don‚Äôt exist and insult the billions of people who still hold them dear and then act surprised there‚Äôs backlash.

Ownership statistics aren't as cut and dried as the rights side of things. The answer to ""some people didn't have these rights before"" shouldn't be ""so now nobody gets rights,"" it should be ""everybody has the same rights."" > Why is it that Americans think guns will keep them safe?

By this logic the US shouldn't exist after all the colonists stole land from the natives by force. As for Israel and Palestine I think of it more as Jews returning to their historical homeland. The Israelites were forced out or into submission by Rome and the Philistines were allowed control, then Arabs invaded and co-opted the Philistines and changed the name to Palestine.

We're currently in Croatia, been here since Thursday last week and the first 4 days were fun. We went to some cities and did some activities and that was all fun and dandy but i really like my personal space and time so in the evening i like to just chill by myself but they kept wanting to play drinking games and go out to bars nd shit. Me being the people pleaser i am i went with them even though i didnt want to.  Now we're here till Friday and currently they all wanted to go to a hardcore festival. We all got tickets for Monday Tuesday and Wednesday. I'm not a big enjoyer of hardcore, im closer to a hater than a lover but i still went with them to give it a try. In hindsight it was the worst decision. The tickets were pretty expensive and i absolutely do not enjoy the music. I left early on Monday and didnt go on Tuesday and probably will not go today either as it just makes me depressed being there. I prefer taking my vacations relaxed and going with the flow from day to day and see what i want to do. I also love just staying a day at home just listening to some music and reading a book or something.

2023-09-18	Of course I have an intense emotional attachment. You're talking about rebuilding an involuntary, non-criminal prison system that people like me can be put in without their own consent or a criminal trial. Having family and resources isn't an advantage for people like me after people like you build this system, it's a downside. The previous version of this system was **full** of people like me whose families put them into that system because they didn't want to deal with their mentally ill family members any longer. That's not a valid reason to lock people up indefinitely. If you want to be allowed to put people in jail, we have a system for that - you need to criminalize being homeless in public, and then you need to arrest, try, and convict the homeless people for their crime, and then you can put them in jail. This is the same process we use for alcoholics having mental breaks in public. There is no reason that mentally ill people deserve less protection from you than alcoholic people get. You are cloaking your horrible dehumanization of people like me in a shroud of fake empathy, acting like shielding these homeless people from criminal trials even though you plan to abduct them and lock them into a facility is a kindness - it's not.  Mentally ill people deserve just as much protection as alcoholics and other sane but fucked up people get, which means if you want to put them in jail, you need to criminalize the thing you want them to stop doing and then you need to go through the same process with them that everyone else has to go through. We deserve a trial the same way your alcoholic does before you should be allowed to put us in prison. But the reality is you already know there's no political will for jailing that many homeless people - so instead you present the same solution, but pretend it's fundamentally different in some way from jail, even though the last time we did this, it absolutely just was ""jail, but even less oversight and no appeals process"".	141500	r/PoliticalDiscussion	403266

11/30/23	"Recognize and restrict,"""" in the context of the First Amendment, is extremely difficult -- as it should be. The alternative is trusting some outside body/authority with deciding what is and isn't valid information. I don't trust my media to do that, and I certainly wouldn't trust a government body. The bigger problem, I think, is that many (perhaps most) people don't want unbiased, fact-based and non-propagandistic information. They want their biases confirmed. Well-meaning efforts at better civics education, increased critical thinking skills etc. can't put a dent in that until and unless society rewards asking questions more than going along with whatever the in-group says you should believe.

11/21/23	"I'm also a short dude, so I think I can kind of understand how you feel. For me at least, it was so hard to keep hoping I would get just a little taller, but it not happening. I remember looking up ""how old can you be and still get a growth spurt"" in my early 20s. At times, I don't feel like a complete man and because I'm not even average height, I'll never really be a man in the eyes of other people. I remember being straight up rejected because I was too short and who can guess how often I was (literally) overlooked by women because of my height.  But it's fine. It's not ideal, but barely anything is. I was able to make friends and pursue most of the things I wanted. There were definitely times women I was interested in were also interested in me. I just didn't see it at the time because I was so sure that she wasn't ""really"" interested in me because of this and that. Some people kind of baby me, but if I'm being honest, I kind of play into it so if I made a mistake, they're fine with it and when I'm doing something well, they are overly impressed.  I hate when people here on Reddit tell you how there's other people who are short and successful or now it's all in your head.

11/20/23	"Fake it till you make it. That's how I got good. I used to have nooo social skills I was so shy and decided to become a nurse. What an idiot. But I find that starting with the classics opens the door and you can quickly judge if the other person wants to talk or not. Also I like to let the other person speak, listen to them and unless they directly ask me questions, I kind of put them in the lead of the discussion and nudge them in the direction I want. Like we will talk about their family, then they will drop something about their son or daughter and I would go: you told me your son was doing x y z. """"Does he like that? I always found it interesting."""" And then the other person can go on. Also I found out the classics were classics for a reason. Weathers and such are great discussion openers. Complimenting politely on a detail is nice too but can lead to a closed route if you don't have a follow up. And one last thing I read and was useful was FORD.

Fake news were found out. One thing I know, we barely had any wars and World War 3 was not as real as it is now under this current president.

Imperialism wasn't capitalism- it was mercantilism, which state owned companies.  If the US was 'exploiting' the developing world through corporations, why do we see a steady increase in the standard of living.  The problem most of the time is that what looks to us like exploitation is actually an improvement from even poorer living conditions.

8/14/23	"Political recognition is based on interests and conditions.  It was a long time before the US recognized the Soviet Union or Communist China; it was finally done because the US felt it was in the interests of the US to do so.   The Taliban is well aware that when the goal of the US was revenge, it toppled the Taliban government quite easily in 2001.  When the goal of the US was to extract itself from a messy civil war in the late 2010s, it could cut a deal with the US on a departure.  But if it was a key US interest in toppling the Taliban because it let Afghanistan become a safe haven for foreign terrorists, the US would topple it again.  So the Taliban already has a strong interest in not becoming a base for terrorists to launch attacks against the US.  With or without any recognition.   They won't be a useful US ally - too poor, too ideologically different.   So recognition remains just something that the US would do if it was in US interests - such as the Taliban moderating its stance or allowing more rights."	106596	r/PoliticalDiscussion	373397	0

A former cruise ship carrying less than 10% of a normal cruise passenger load and 98% of them teamsters.  It took 24 hours and only four people (and we were two of them) embarked without a vehicle.  It stormed the entire way and I had a great time.  Gave me a whole new appreciation for how intrepid the folks of the Med were 2000 years ago crossing it in wooden sailing vessels.
